# Portfolio - Ganesh Derkar

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website serves as a showcase for my work, skills, and projects as a web developer. It includes a contact form where users can send inquiries directly to me. Below is all the information you need to understand, install, and contribute to this project.

## Features

- **Contact Form:** Users can send a message to me directly (the EmailJS integration for the contact form is planned and will be integrated soon).
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be fully responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Personalized Content:** The portfolio includes sections about me, my skills, projects, and an easy way for potential clients, employers, or collaborators to get in touch.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It powers the dynamic elements of the portfolio.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling and ensuring a responsive, mobile-first layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** JavaScript is used for dynamic behavior and functionality.

### Backend (Planned):
- **EmailJS (coming soon):** I plan to integrate EmailJS for the contact form, allowing users to send messages to my email (`ganesh.derkar.dev@gmail.com`).

EmailJS Integration (Coming Soon)

Currently, the EmailJS integration for the contact form is not yet implemented. Once this feature is added, users will be able to send messages directly to my email address: ganesh.derkar.dev@gmail.com.

Hereâ€™s what will happen once integrated

   # When users fill out the contact form, their message, along with their name and email, will be sent to me through EmailJS.

   # This will allow for seamless communication directly from the website.

Future Features

I have several ideas for enhancing the portfolio in the future. These include

  #  Blog Section: I plan to add a blog where I can share tutorials, technical insights, and personal experiences as a developer.

   # Animations & Transitions: Adding animations to enhance the user experience, such as hover effects, scroll animations, and smooth transitions between sections.

   # Accessibility Enhancements: Improving the accessibility of the website for better navigation, especially for users with disabilities.
